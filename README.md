# startup-security-notes
the notes for my cybersecurity journey

This repository documents my learning process and security analysis for a startup web application (currently in beta).  
My goal is to learn by doing: mapping the system, asking critical security questions, and documenting what I discover.

## Contents

- `system-mapping.md`: asset mapping, login, backend structure
- `login-auth/`: JWT vs Session, hashing notes
- `api-security/`: rate limiting, endpoint risks
- `notes/`: raw ideas, questions, weekly logs
